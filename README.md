# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION-USING-ML
# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model for detecting spam SMS messages. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The goal is to create a robust and accurate classifier that can be used to identify and filter out spam messages.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git
   cd sms-spam-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can use the trained model to predict whether a given SMS message is spam or ham. See the example below:

python

from sms_spam_detection import SpamDetector

# Load the trained model
model = SpamDetector.load_model("path/to/your/model")

# Predict whether a message is spam or ham
message = "Congratulations! You've won a free cruise."
result = model.predict(message)

print(f"Prediction: {result['class']} (Probability: {result['probability']})")
Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the data directory. It includes labeled examples of spam and ham messages. Feel free to replace it with your own dataset if needed.

Model Training
Details about the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process can be found in the train_model.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are reported in the evaluation_results.txt file.

Results
A summary of the model's performance and any interesting findings are documented in the results.md file.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
